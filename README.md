WordPress site built for client (NSE Composites), based on design comps from contracting designer. I would have preferred to use groups and repeaters with the ACF installation, but the client preferred not to pay the yearly fee for ACF pro. I'd likely use custom Gutenberg blocks if I was doing this again, but they were too new at the time.
